              If you're starting from nothing, it can require significant resources just to find several people you want
              to hire individually, without even considering whether they'd make a good team.  From balancing skillsets,
              to ensuring compatible personalities, <b>there's a lot that goes into building a great team</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, everyone you just hired simultaneously has to get used to the company, the product, the tools, the process,
              and each other&hellip;  All said and done, <b>it can take months before everyone hits their stride</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or, you can hire a team that's already balanced, and already works well together.  The team can hit the ground running, using
              tools and process they're all familiar with.  That means less time to get to your minimum viable product, less
              seed money required, and <b>a better chance of success</b>.

                August 1981, days away from turning seven, IBM announced the release of the IBM PC.  My dad brought one home and I became fortunate to grow up a child of DOS 1.0 and 80's bullentin board systems; I have been enthralled from then on. After graduating magna cum laude in Finance from the University of Central Florida, I moved to New York and began working with my first tech startup.  Since then, I have been lucky to continue to build and work with the best people developing products from the ground up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working with architects and fashion designers in NY helped shape my eye for design.  And being able to take on very challenging development tasks has given me the sense that anything can be built, especially with the right team.

                I love helping others learn and excel -- it's a tiny rush every time I get to be part of someone's "AHA!" moment.  When
                I'm part of a dev team, that means I look for ways to raise the bar for everyone, and to ensure both the code
                architecture and dev process make it easier for everyone to do whatever they need to do.  I'm always happy to talk through
                possible solutions with a teammate, whether the problem is one I'll be working on myself or one someone else is tackling.
              </p>
              <p>
                With nearly 2 decades of experience writing software, I know how important communication is to the big picture.  Sometimes
                the best solution to a problem <i>doesn't</i> involve writing any code, and the only way to figure that out is to ask the right
                questions of the right people.  I'm comfortable discussing problems and solutions with all sorts of stakeholders, regardless
                of their level of technical understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to coding, I like to take on big-scope challenges, the sort where it's not fully clear what form the solution
                should take.  The more brainstorming I have to do in the process, the more proud I'll be of the result.

                I'm a computer nerd at heart, with 14+ years of software engineering, testing, and design.
                My main passion in life is clean reusable code, constant learning, and creating amazing things from nothing.
                My current favorite technologies of trade are NodeJS, Angular, Scala, PlayFramework, git, JavaScript, and CoffeeScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am extremely active in the open source community. I'm sure to dig into many repositories to aid in bug fixes, advice, and/or management
                of open source projects. Github, Bitbucket and the like are the future. OSS 4 life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides coding, I enjoys crossfit, hiking, family, and friends.

                Whether it's a fascination with music, health, games, cooking, history, software, or any other of my many interests, I
                get hooked and stubborn while yearning to hone my skills.  There's a sense of urgency that I experience when something
                comes to me worth solving or reflecting upon, and in computer science, there's certainly no shortage of brilliant solutions
                and interesting problems worth thinking about.
              </p>
              <p>Pursuing a career in software development is one of the best decisions I've made for myself.  It compliments my enjoyment
                of getting lost in my work while being an avenue through which I feel I can impart some sort of positive change in this
